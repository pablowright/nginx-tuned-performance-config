# Notes and mods added by -prw 06-2018:
# After making changes restart nginx: 'systemctl stop|start|restart nginx'

# PRW: Optimizing the Backlog Queue: The general rule is when a connection is established, it is put into the “listen” queue of a
# listen socket.
# Under normal load, either the queue is small or there is no queue at all. But under high load, the queue can grow dramatically,
# resulting in uneven performance, dropped connections, and increased latency.
# command: 'netstat -Lan' will display the current listen queue.
#
# PRW: Tuning the Operating System:
# Increase the value of the net.core.somaxconn kernel parameter from its default value (128) to a value high enough for a large burst
# of traffic. PRW: set this value to 4096 by adding the following line to /etc/sysctl.conf: net.core.somaxconn = 4096
#
# PRW: Since somaxconn kernel parameter is now set to a value greater than 512, we need to change the backlog parameter in the
# NGINX listen directive. See 'server {' directive, above.
